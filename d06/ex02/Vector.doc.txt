<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Class Vector  allows you to do manipulations with 3d vectors.

It receives array of destination and origin coordinates through Vertex instance:
$kwargs['dest', 'orig' => both are objects of class Vertex]

to get Vector you need to substract orig from dest;

The class provides the following methods :

float magnitude(): 
returns the float type length of the vector.

Vector normalize():
returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is
already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add(Vector $rhs):
returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector sub(Vector $rhs):
returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite():
returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct($k):
returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float dotProduct(Vector $rhs):
returns the scalar multiplication of both vec- tors.

float cos(Vector $rhs):
returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vec- tors.

Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs):
returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right-hand rule)
